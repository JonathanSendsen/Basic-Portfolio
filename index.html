        <p>My name is Jonathan Sendsen, as you can tell by the header in the nav, fingers crossed it appears there. I am an individual who is constantly looking to learn and grasp new concepts. I starting exploring into web development last year, when I was working as a researcher at the Univerity of Waterloo.
          </p> 
        <p>I caught the tech fever in Waterloo, and never looked back. This course will push me out of my comfort zone, and will be demanding. As long as I put my best effort forward and continue to explore areas that are uncomfortable to me, I will succeed.
      </p>
    <p>I am really looking forward to the knowledge transfer this course will provide me with. I am extremely happy with all the instructors and TA's. They are very knowledagble and more than willing to help when necessary. Thank you for everything!
