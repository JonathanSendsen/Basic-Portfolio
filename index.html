        <p>My name is Jonathan Sendsen, as you can tell by the header in the nav (fingers crossed it appears there). I am an individual who is constantly looking to learn and grasp new concepts. I starting exploring into web development last year when I was working as a researcher at the Univerity of Waterloo.
      </p> 
     <p>I caught the tech fever in Waterloo as a researcher and never looked back since. This course is one that will push me out of my comfort zone and will be extremely time consuming. As long as I put my best effort forward and continue to explore areas that are uncomfortable to me, I will succeed.
